# Global informations üåç

## Global Integrated Commands ‚öôÔ∏è

The API uses integrated commands:

| Command | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| `$status` | Send information about the current API üìä |
| `$model [number]` | Exchange the current model for another model in list, the input must be by the list number üîÑ [DISABLED]|
| `$modelList` | List all Models Avaliable üìú |
| `$clean` | Clean the Model memory üßπ |
| `$temp` | Change the `temperature` of model (0 to 1) üå°Ô∏è |
| `$top` | change the `top_p` of model (0 to 2)  ‚¨ÜÔ∏è |

### Temperature and top_p üî•

temperature and top_p are the fine controls of the API, with temperature being the generation engine and top_p being the selection filter, which can be random or precise üéõÔ∏è

They are limited to
- temperature >= 0 and <= 1 üå°Ô∏è
- top_p >= 0 and <= 2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

### Manipulation of fine motors üïπÔ∏è

To manipulate fine engines, this command must be carried out, either in the discord model or on its main website using the period instead of the comma for decimal numbers.

example: `$top 1.5` | result: top_p changed to 1.5 ‚úÖ
