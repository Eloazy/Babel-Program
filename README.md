## Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

Its use is local only: Babelite host in `PORT: 1025` üè†

> [!WARNING]
> Baberome only suported by babelite ^3.0.1 üìè

Discord Branchs (Cardial and BabelCord) üí¨

> [!WARNING]
> Have limits of 2000 characters, returning an error if this limit is exceeded üìè

## Connection üîó

Done by `POST` method accessing `localhost on port 1025`
Receiving and sending only information in `application/json`

May return the response in `result` or `result.result` depending on the method of submission

*Usually returns in `result`*

## Key instructions üîë

The API uses its own key, in the future a new branch will probably be created for public use where the use of a private key will be required. üóùÔ∏è

## Integrated Commands ‚öôÔ∏è

The API uses integrated commands:

| Command | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| `$status` | Send information about the current API üìä |
| `$model [number]` | Exchange the current model for another model in list, the input must be by the list number üîÑ |
| `$modelList` | List all Models Avaliable üìú |
| `$clean` | Clean the Model memory üßπ |
| `$temp` | Change the `temperature` of model (0 to 1) üå°Ô∏è |
| `$top` | change the `top_p` of model (0 to 2)  ‚¨ÜÔ∏è |

- For Discord: `/babelaife $[command]`
- For Babelite: `$[command]`

### Temperature and top_p üî•

temperature and top_p are the fine controls of the API, with temperature being the generation engine and top_p being the selection filter, which can be random or precise üéõÔ∏è

They are limited to
- temperature >= 0 and <= 1 üå°Ô∏è
- top_p >= 0 and <= 2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

### Manipulation of fine motors üïπÔ∏è

To manipulate fine engines, this command must be carried out, either in the discord model or on its main website using the period instead of the comma for decimal numbers.

example: `$top 1.5` | result: top_p changed to 1.5 ‚úÖ
